/// L1 delayed inbox — the mechanism that makes Vela censorship-resistant.

/// If the Vela sequencer refuses to include a user's transaction, the user
/// submits it directly to the `DelayedInbox` smart contract on L1.  After
/// `timeout` elapses without the sequencer including it, anyone can advance
/// the inbox pointer and force the transaction into the next committed batch.
/// This makes censorship-resistance equivalent to an Ethereum L2 (the same
/// pattern used by Arbitrum's delayed inbox).
///
/// # Flow
///
/// 1. User calls `submit_forced(request, from)` on L1 (simulated here in
///    software).
/// 2. The committer calls `drain_eligible(timeout)` before every batch.
///    Transactions older than `timeout` are returned and **prepended** to the
///    pending batch so they are the first to execute.
/// 3. If the sequencer has already included the transaction normally (via the
///    fast path), it will not appear in the delayed inbox and nothing happens.
